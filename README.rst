About
-----

The Rare Disease Registry Framework (RDRF) is an open source tool for the creation of web-based patient registries. What makes it unique is that data entry forms and questionnaires are based on reusable data element definitions (called "Common Data Elements" ) which can be created and/or loaded into the system at runtime. This means that registries can be created and modified without changes to the source code. RDRF has been developed at the `Centre for Comparative Genomics <http://ccg.murdoch.edu.au>`_, Murdoch University, Western Australia in partnership with the `Office of Population Health Genomics <http://www.genomics.health.wa.gov.au>`_, Department of Health Western Australia.

For developers
--------------

We do our Python 2 development using Docker_ containers and docker-compose_.
You will have to set up Docker and docker-compose on your development machine.

All the development tasks can be done by using the ``develop.sh`` shell script in this directory.
Please run it without any arguments for help on its usage.

A typical usage is::

    ./develop.sh dev_build
    ./develop.sh dev

This will start up all the docker containers needed for dev. 
You can access the RDRF application on http://localhost:8000
(replace localhost with ``$ boot2docker ip`` if using boot2docker) after this.
You can login with one of the default users *admin/admin*.
