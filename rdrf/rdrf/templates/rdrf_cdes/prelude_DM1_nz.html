<p>
We are inviting you or
your child to take part in the New Zealand registry for participants
with neuromuscular conditions (NZ NMD Registry).  This registry is
part of the global family of TREAT-NMD registries, and in New Zealand
it is an initiative of the Muscular Dystrophy Association of New
Zealand (MDA), a not-for-profit registered charity dedicated to
supporting people with neuromuscular conditions.
</p>

<p>
Take your time to read the information
and decide whether you wish to take part.
</p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
Neuromuscular diseases are conditions that affect the nerves and muscles.
TREAT-NMD is an international network designed to bring together the
world’s leading neuromuscular specialists.  TREAT-NMD aims to
improve standards of care, improve treatment and search for cures for
affected participants.
</p>

<p>
Major progress has been made in recent
years towards finding new treatments for diseases like Duchenne
muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, myotonic dystrophy,
facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
and others. Many of these treatments target specific genetic defects,
some of which are rare and affect only a few participants in the
world.  When a trial of these treatments is being planned it is
important that suitable participants can be found and contacted
quickly.  One way of ensuring this can happen is to collect each
participant’s details in a participant registry.  This contains the
important information that researchers will need, such as that
participant’s particular genetic test result, and other key
information about their disease.
</p>

<p>
The data held in the registry will
also help researchers answer other important questions such as how
common these diseases are.  It will also be a way to inform
participants about the latest information relevant to their disease. 
</p>

<h4>Am I eligible to participate?</h4>
<p>
All people in New Zealand affected by
a neuromuscular disease are eligible to register with the NZ NMD
Registry. The NZ NMD Registry is sponsored by the MDA, but any New
Zealand resident can participate in this registry, you do not have to
be a member of the MDA.
</p>

Whether you want to take part or not
is entirely your choice and your decision will not affect your future
healthcare. If you do agree to take part, you can change your mind at
any time and we can remove your information from the registry.
</p>

<p>
If your affected child is able to
understand what this registry is about we will also ask for their
consent.
</p>

<h4>What do I have to do?</h4>
<p>
If you agree to participate you will
need to sign the consent form and return it to the registry curator
along with a registration questionnaire.  In this questionnaire you
will be asked for some personal details, such as your age and
ethnicity, and some information about your disease.  The registry
will also collect the results of your genetic testing when this has
been performed.  You may wish to complete the questionnaire with the
assistance of your doctor or MDA fieldworker.  If you are not sure of
the answer to any question discuss this with your doctor, MDA
fieldworker or the registry curator.  The registry curator can
approach your doctor on your behalf to clarify the answer to any
question if required.
</p>

<p>
    The registry curator will be available
to discuss any other questions or concerns you have about the
questionnaire. You will be requested to update your clinical record
once per year.  We also request that you contact the registry curator
if your contact details change or there are major changes in your
clinical condition.
</p>

<h4>What happens to the information I provide?</h4>
<p>
The information you provide will be
stored securely and confidentially in the New Zealand Neuromuscular
Disease Registry on computers at Auckland City Hospital and the
Office of Population Health Genomics, Perth.  No unauthorised people
will be able to gain access to any information about you.
</p>

<p>
In addition if there is an
international database for your condition, e.g. the TREAT NMD
Duchenne / Becker muscular dystrophy global database, your anonymised
information will be forwarded to that database. In
these international registries, the clinical and genetic information
that you have given to us will be identified only by an anonymous
code, not by your name.
</p>

<p>
Researchers worldwide who have been approved by their own local
ethics committee and by the TREAT-NMD governing board and ethics
council can access this information.
</p>

<p>
If no suitable database has been
established, your information will be stored locally until an
international database is set up. When that happens you will be
contacted by the curator who will obtain from you the details
required for that database.</p>

<p>
If a clinical trial or other research
study is identified for which you might be eligible the New Zealand
Registry will “de-code” the data to find your personal details
and then contact you. If you are interested you can then contact the
study organiser. Your name or other personal details will not be
given to the researchers. You are free to make your own decision
about whether or not you wish to participate in the trial, and may
wish to discuss this with your doctor.
</p>

<h4>Who do I contact for further information?</font></h4>
<p>
Thank you for making the time to read
about and consider taking part in the New Zealand Neuromuscular
Disease Registry.  We hope you will be interested in submitting your
details.
