<h1>Australian National Neuromuscular Disorders (NMD) Registry</h1>
<h2>Patient Information and Informed Consent</h2>

The Australian National NMD Registry is a member of the TREAT-NMD
global network of national registries.

<h3>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</h3>

We invite you to register in the Australian National Neuromuscular
Disorders (NMD) Registry (The Registry). You can fill in and sign the
consent form yourself provided you are 18 years of age or older.
Before you do, it is important that you understand what is involved
and what will be done with the information you provide. This form
contains answers to some of the questions you might have. At the end
of the form there is a section for you to sign to confirm that you
agree to participate. If you have any questions after reading this
form, please contact the relevant person in your state before signing
the form. You will find a list of contact details at the end of this
document. This project has been approved by the local Human
Research Ethics Committee (For each site the HREC reference is
provided at the end of the document.)
<p></p>
<h4>What is a patient registry and why would you want to participate in one?</h4>
Scientific advances over recent years have led to substantial changes in the
treatment of many conditions. For some potential new treatments plans
for large studies involving patients from more than one country are
already in place.
<p></p>
When
a clinical trial is being planned, it is very important that patients
suitable for that trial can be found and contacted quickly. The best
way of ensuring this can happen is to collect patients’ details in
a single patient registry, which contains all the information needed,
including each patient’s particular genetic defect and other key
information about their condition. 
<br>
The TREAT-NMD network is creating this kind of registry in countries
across Europe. As well as each national registry, TREAT-NMD is also
creating a single global registry which will combine the information
from each of the national registries around the world, including
those in Australia. This will ensure that patients who register in
their national registry anywhere in the world can be contacted for
voluntary participation if their profile fits a clinical trial. In
addition, these registries will help researchers to answer questions
such as how common conditions like NMD are in Europe, America,
Australia, Japan and other member countries. This information will
also support other activities to improve patient care, such as the
assessment of standards of care. 
<br>
<h4>Whose data is being collected in this registry?</h4>
This Registry is for individuals living with a Neuromuscular Disorder and
known carriers. Examples of disorders included in The Registry are:
<p></p>
Duchenne muscular dystrophy<br>
Becker muscular dystrophy<br>
Spinal muscular atrophy<br>
Myotonic dystrophy<br>
Congenital muscular dystrophy<br>
Fascioscapulohumeral dystrophy<br>
<p></p>
The primary purpose of The Registry is to identify persons who might be
suitable for new treatments, and to help clinicians identify the highest standards of caring for patients with NMD.
<p></p>
<h4>What information is being collected and why?</h4>
The Registry will contain demographic information about the patient
including: name, address, date of birth, email and contact number as
well as your doctor’s name, address and telephone number. This
information is called identifiable information and will be stored in
a secure and confidential manner in order to prevent you from being
identified by anyone other than those directly involved with your
clinical care. Your regular doctor shall provide any relevant
clinical data and the genetic testing laboratory services will
provide the specific genetic typing. This information shall all be
collected through the clinical site where you enrol. The clinical and
genetic information will be stored in a re-identifiable form. This
means the clinical and genetic data will be separated from the
identifiable information (demographic details as listed above) and
stored in a separate secure datafile with a unique identifier code
attached.
<p></p>
The identifiable information will enable you to be contacted quickly
about any clinical trials for which you may be eligible. The
information in The Registry will also allow us to provide you with
new information relevant to standards of care for your condition, and
to collect a small amount of statistical information that may be used
to improve Australian and international knowledge of NMD.
<p></p>
<h4>Who should fill in this form?</h4>
If you are the patient, you can fill in and sign the form yourself,
provided you are 18 years of age or older. If you are under 18 years
of age but can understand this information, you may sign the consent
form, but we also require your parent or guardian to sign it with
you. Whatever your age, please discuss registration with your family
and/or your doctor, and don’t hesitate to contact us if you have
any questions. If you are the parent or guardian of a child who is
not old enough to understand this form, please sign the form yourself
if you want your child’s data to be included in The Registry.
<p></p>
<h4>What do I have to do and where will my data go?</h4>
If you agree to take part in this project, you should read this patient
information and sign the consent form at the end. Your doctor or a
Clinical Coordinator will then add some personal data and some
information about your condition into The Registry with you. It is
very important that The Registry is able to collect your clinical
information and also details of genetic testing to identify the DNA
sequence of the gene that has caused your neuromuscular disorder.
This clinical information will be provided to The Registry by your
clinician from your medical records. If you have not already had a
genetic test this will need to be performed by a designated
laboratory before your registration can be completed. The information
you provide and the genetic information about your gene sequence will
then be entered into the Australian National NMD Registry by the
specific clinical site where you have enrolled.
<p></p>
Nationally The Registry will be supervised by the Office of Population Health
Genomics, Department of Health, Western Australia. Additionally an
Advisory Committee of experts from all around Australia and New
Zealand provide guidance and advice on the management of The
Registry. For more on the Advisory Committee Terms of Reference and
The Registry Charter refer to the Australian NMD Registry website.
<p></p>
<h4>Where will my data go and who will be able to access it?</h4>

Your data will be stored securely on a Department of Health WA server and
no unauthorized people will be able to gain access to any information
Only specific people within The Registry are given authority to
access identifiable data.Your clinical and genetic data will be
stored in a re-identifiable form. In the event of your death the data
will be archived into two separate archives. The clinical and genetic
data, along with the specific codes will be archived into one archive
and the identifiable data will be stored in another archive. Access
to the archive containing the clinical and genetic data will be
subject to approval from a Human Research Ethics Committee and The
Registry oversight committee (NMD Advisory Committee). Only the
national curator of The Registry will be able to access the archive
containing the identifiable data and this will only be for the
purposes of linking your record with other health data. At no time
during this linkage will your identifiable data be disclosed to
anyone outside The Registry. All archived data will be retained in
the event of your death and stored securely for the life of The
Registry. This archived data may be withdrawn from The Registry by
the consenting parents or by an adult with the appropriate power of
attorney.
<p></p>
Selected data (non-identifiable) about all patients in each country’s
national registry will then be fed into the TREAT-NMD global
registry, which is accessible to researchers worldwide. When planning
clinical trials, researchers can search this global registry for
participants eligible for their trial, based on the patients’
clinical and genetic data. Only researchers who have been approved by their own local ethics
committee and by the Australian National NMD governing board and
ethics council can access The Registry.
<p></p>
In the TREAT-NMD global registry, your clinical data and genetic data
will be identified only by an anonymous code, not by your name.
This means that when researchers search The Registry, they will not
be able to access your personal information (name, address etc.), but
only the information they need about your condition that will help
them decide whether you might be suitable for the trial. If they
think you meet the criteria and might benefit from the trial, they
will contact the person in charge of The Registry.
<p></p>
Staff with adequate authority within the specific clinical site you have
enrolled in for The Registry will “de-code” the data to find out
your personal details and will ask your nominated doctor to contact
you to give you information about the trial or about any other issues
relevant to your condition. Aside from the national curator of The
Registry, staff within other states will not have access to your
personal information. Neither The Registry nor any third party global
registry will give your name or any other personal information to
researchers or other third parties. If you are interested in the
information you receive about a particular clinical trial, you will
be given additional information about the trial by your doctor.
<p></p>
You are completely free to make your own decision about your
participation in any trial we inform you about.
If you decide not to take part in a particular trial, your data will
still be kept in The Registry and we will continue to inform you,
through your doctor, about other trials unless you tell us not to.
If, after careful consideration and discussion with your doctor, you
decide to take part in the trial you will need to review and sign a
separate consent form. Your doctor will then contact us at The
Registry, and we will in turn, send the required information to the
researchers running the trial.
<p></p>
<h4>How long will my data be kept?</h4>
Unless you notify The Registry coordinator that you wish to withdraw your
consent to participate, your data will be kept indefinitely on The
Registry under the responsibility of the Director of the Office of
Population Health Genomics, Department of Health in Western
Australia. If The Registry closes down or ceases to function, then
all records held within The Registry will be stored in a secure
setting by the national curator for a period of 10 years and then
destroyed. 
<p></p>
<h4>How will my privacy be protected?</h4>
Registry is a stored electronic record of a patient’s personal,
clinical and genetic test data. These data are stored in separate
files with the clinical and genetic data stored  in a coded file.
This file will be subject to the regulations on data protection,
at both state and national levels, and we will only transfer
non-identifiable data to any global registry under national laws.
Any information we collect in The Registry that can identify you will
be treated as confidential. We can disclose identified information
only with your permission, except as required by law. All
confidential information shall be encrypted and stored securely, in
accordance with each state’s and national privacy laws.
If we publish any research or other documents based on data from the
registries, this research will never identify you by name.
<p></p>
Third parties wishing to have access to data in The Registry or the
TREAT-NMD global registry (such as researchers or companies planning
clinical trials or conducting research on new treatments) will only
have access to information identifiable by a code.
Before they are granted access even to this coded information, they
must have the approval of a Human Research Ethics Committee. Your
data will not be made available to employers, government departments,
insurance companies or educational institutions. Your information
will remain confidential except in the case of a legal requirement to
pass on personal information to authorised third parties. This
requirement is standard and applies to information collected both in
research and non-research situations. Such requests to access
information are rare; however we have an obligation to inform you of
this possibility.
<p></p>
<h4>How can I update my data if it changes?</h4>
We will need to review data in The Registry regularly, to ensure that it
is up to date. To do this, we will request your doctor to update your
clinical records at least once per year. In order to help us and your
doctor we ask that you inform your doctor of: any changes in your
contact details (such as change of address); and any major changes in
your medical condition (for example the loss of the ability to walk
unassisted). Reporting to your doctor about any changes is important
as your doctor can then report back to us to modify our records in
order to ensure they are accurate. Your DNA does not change and the
information from your NMD genetic test, once entered, will not need
to be updated.
<p></p>
<h4>Who will have access to my medical records?</h4>
Staff in charge of The Registry might need to gain access to your medical
records to obtain information necessary to The Registry (for example,
we might need to ask your neurologist or geneticist to give us access
to a copy of your genetic report). Only people specifically
authorised by The Registry will be able to do this. This means
researchers will only be able to gain access to your medical records
if they have been approved by an ethics committee and consent is
given by the patient.
<p></p>
<h4>How will I be identified in The Registry?</h4>
Your personal details (name, address etc.) and those of your doctor have
to be stored in The Registry so that we can contact your doctor to
inform you about possible clinical trials or anything else that might
be relevant to your condition. This data will be stored in a secure
manner and your records will be assigned a unique code.
<p></p>
When we transfer your data to any third party, including the global
Treat-NMD registry or other disease registry, we will not transfer
any of your personal details, and your records will only be
identifiable by the code they have been assigned. Researchers
searching in the global registry therefore cannot identify you
personally from the information they can access. Only the person in
charge of The Registry (currently the national Curator is A/Prof Hugh
Dawkins, Office of Population Health Genomics, Department of Health
in Western Australia) or a person explicitly appointed by him will be
able to “de-code” the data to get access to your personal details
in relation to Treat-NMD or other enquiries.
<p></p>
<h4>Will my relationship to any affected family members or relatives be linked
to my record?</h4>
It is very useful for The Registry to have a record of your family
history. The Registry proposes to link your record, using only your
unique registry code. The link will show your unique registry code,
your relationship to all consented and registered affected family
members. Only those people with access specifically to your records
will be able to see your details. They will not see any details about
your relative other than their unique identifier and their
relationship to you. The same restrictions will apply to their
records and the registry link to you.
<h4>How will I benefit from registering?</h4>
The Registry is intended as a public service for the benefit of patients
living with NMD. You will not receive any payment or any other
financial benefit as a result of submitting your data to The
Registry. The results of research facilitated by The Registry may be
patentable or may have commercial potential. However, you will not
receive patent rights and will not receive financial benefits from
future commercial development. Nevertheless, there may be other
benefits to participating, including the following:
<p></p>
We will inform your doctor who will inform you if (on the basis of the
information you provide) you might be a suitable candidate for a
certain clinical trial.
<p></p>
We will also inform your doctor who will inform you if we receive any
new information on your condition which might be of interest to you
– for example if we find better ways of caring for patients with
NMD.
<p></p>
The data collected might also provide benefits to other patients with
your condition, for example by revealing statistics on how many
people in Australia and in each of the other contributing countries
have the same condition, or providing information for researchers
interested in the best standards of care for your condition.
<p></p>
We will publish some general statistical information from The Registry
and from the other European and national registries on our website.
<p></p>
<h4>I want to be involved in a clinical trial. If I register, is this guaranteed?</h4>
Although one of the main aims of The Registry is to make it easier for
patients to be recruited for clinical trials, there is no guarantee
that registering your details will ensure you will be involved in a
clinical trial. If you are interested in receiving details of trials
you might be eligible for, please tick the appropriate box at the end
of this form. However, it is important that you understand that
mounting clinical trials is very complex and criteria for inclusion
are sometimes subject to change to meet regulatory and trial design.
Consequently, even if you are contacted or believe that you might be
eligible for a specific trial based on your registry data, it is
still possible that during the assessment process you might not meet
all the essential trial inclusion criteria after all.
<p></p>
<h4>I don’t want to be involved in a clinical trial. Should I still register?</h4>
We hope you will be interested in registering even if you don’t want
to take part in a trial. Your information will still be useful to
researchers who are trying to find out more about patients living
with NMD, and we will still provide you with other information that
might be relevant to your condition. If you do not want to receive
any information about clinical trials that you might be eligible for,
please tick “no” in question 3 of the informed consent section at
the end of this form.
<p></p>
<h4>Do I have to participate in The Registry and can I withdraw if I change
my mind?</h4>
Your participation in this project is completely voluntary. The Federal
Privacy Act and associated principles and guidelines grants you the right to rectify your data or withdraw from further
participation in The Registry at any time. Should you wish to
withdraw from The Registry you will be free to do so without having
to provide any explanation. Once you withdraw your file will be
electronically deleted from The Registry in a secure manner. If you
wish to withdraw, you should get in touch with the staff in charge of
The Registry. Contact details are provided below.
<p></p>
<h4>Who should I contact if I have any questions?</h4>
If you would like any additional information or need to tell us about any change in your data, or if you wish to withdraw your data from The Registry,
please contact the person from the hospital you attend listed in the contact table downloadable at this <a href="{% static 'docs/Australian.NMD.Registry.Contact.List.170517.pdf' %}">link</a>.
